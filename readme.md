Download [Blender 3d](http://www.blender.org/) and install. 

	 Create shortcut for console or CMD.exe
	 Open properties of the shortcut and add key /k 'installetion path to blender.exe'
	 	 For example my shortcut path C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /k "C:\utils\blender-2.73-testbuild1-win32
	 Click on the shortcut and run blende with system console window.
	 In blender choose screen layout SCRIPTING
	 Open script file and run it.
	 Switch to the default layout.
	 The misc tab shows custom toolbar with custom buttons.
	
You can select 3d object and press some buttons, the information is printed in the system console.
Information about objects I'm using in my project and it not useful for most people. 
But you can see ho create own toolbar in blender.

Script can be writen and edited in script layout.
